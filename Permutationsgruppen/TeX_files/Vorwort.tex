The plan is to go rather fast through the first chapter of this book(to get fast to K-Theory), take some notes, write down ideas, examples and remarks, rewrite proofs, so that i can understand them in my way. Also add sometimes reminders to concepts/definitions, so that i have a good overview about vector bundles and of course K-Theory. I will also use notation from courses i took in the past. But I will put remarks for the reader.
Hope you will find these notes helpful in any way.
